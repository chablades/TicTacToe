# Tic-Tac-Toe (Java, Encapsulation, Inheritance) <

## Introduction
A Tic-Tac-Toe game that focuses on encapsulation and inheritance.

**Tools:** Java 17+, any IDE (IntelliJ/Eclipse/VS Code), GitHub Classroom (recommended)

## How to Run
Launch and run ConsoleApp.java

## Design Rationale

### Extensions

**SmartAIPlayer:** A smart AI player that uses basic heuristics to determine winning opportunities and blocking the opponent from winning.
**NxN Board:** Parameterize size; make win condition configurable (e.g., 3‑in‑a‑row on any N).
**MiniMax AI:** A smart AI player that uses DFS algorithm and assign heuristic values to terminal states and backtracks to determine the fastest way to win. It also utilizes Alpha-Beta pruning to cut search trees that won't affect the decision and optimize performance.
